The technique of grouping information, organizing ideas into categories, and creating tags to help you find grouped information at a later stage is the art of reference notes.

This is where you might write a doc with links to more reading in the permanent notes or compiling a cheat sheet. 

These are the notes you look to when you are *referencing* or consuming your notes after they've been written.
