## Zettels
Zettels, or permanent notes, are stand-alone ideas that can be made without any direct context to other sourced information such as books, videos, or other available data.  

Permanent notes can be made as a recap or summary of the information just researched or learned, but can also be thoughts that popped into your brain while thinking over a myriad of information or while analyzing any given context.
